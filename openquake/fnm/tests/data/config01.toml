# This is an example configuration file for the component of FERMI that from a
# set of sections creates the multi-fault ruptures required for computing the
# rates using - for example - an inversion procedure. 
#
# The configuration file contains four main parts:
# - General
# - Ruptures
# - Connections
# - Sections

# This part contains general information about the analysis such as the name
# of the GIS file with the geometries of the faults 
[general] 

# This is the name of the GIS file containing information on the geometry of
# the sections. It can be either a .geojson file or a shapefile.

# Part containing information used to create the ruptures

# Defines a range of aspect ratios (ARs) used to filter out the ruptures   
# whose AS is outside of this range
aspect_ratios = [0, 100]

# Part containing information used to define connections between sections

# Part containing information on sections and subsections 
[sections]

# Instructions for building the subsections. Positive values correspond to 
# distances in km. When negative distances are provided, the code takes first 
# the second value that specifies the number of subdivisions along the dip. 
# When this value is equal to -1 it means that the subsections will fill the 
# entire section width. For a value equal to -2, the code will create 2 rows 
# of subsections along the width. The first value, when negative, is a 
# multiplier of the subsection width. For example, for the case [-0.5, -1.0]
# the width of subsections will be equal to the section width and the 
# subsection length will be half of the width.
