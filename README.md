# OpenQuake Model Building Toolkit
The OpenQuake Model Building Toolkit (OQ-MBTK) is a container for various packages each one with specific modelling or analysis capabilities. The project started with the `mbt` package which provides tools for the construction of components of a PSHA earthquake occurrence model. The repo now contains a module for processing catalogues (`cat`), one supports workflows creating an earthquake occurrence model for the OQ Engine (`mbt` and `wkf`), one for the construction of the ground-motion characterisation (`smt`), one for the modelling of subduction sources and the classification of an earthquake catalogue by tectonic region (`sub`) and FERMI, a tool for the construction of occurrence models for fault systems (`fnm`).
