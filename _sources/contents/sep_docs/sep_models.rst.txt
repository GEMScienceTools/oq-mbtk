Liquefaction and Landslide models
=================================

Liquefaction models
-------------------

Two liquefaction models were are implemented in the OQ-MBTK. The first
is the method developed for the HAZUS software by the US Federal
Emergency Management Agency. This model involves categorization of sites
into liquefaction susceptibility classes based on geotechnical
characteristics, and a quanitative probability model for each
susceptibility class. The second model is an academic model developed by
Zhu and others (2015). It is statistical model incorporating only
DEM-derived quantities for site characterization.

HAZUS
~~~~~

The HAZUS model classifies each site into a liquefaction susceptibility
class (LSC) based on the geologic and geotechnical characteristics of
the site, such as the sedimentological type and the deposition age of
the unit. In addition to the LSC and the local ground acceleration at
each site, the depth to groundwater at the site and the magnitude of the
causative earthquake will affect the probability that a given site will
experience liquefaction.

The equation that describes this probability is:

.. math:: P(L) = \frac{P(L | PGA=a) \cdot P_{ml}}{K_m K_w} 

:math:`P(L|PGA=a)` is the conditional probability that a site will fail
based on the PGA and the LSC. :math:`P_{ml}` is the fraction of the
total mapped area that will experience liquefaction if
:math:`P(L|PGA=a)` reaches 1. These terms both have LSC-specific
coefficients; these are shown in Table 1.

:math:`K_m` is a magnitude-correction factor that scales :math:`P(L)`
for earthquake magnitudes other than *M*\ =7.5, potentially to account
for the duration of shaking (longer shaking increases liquefaction
probability). :math:`K_w` is a groundwater depth correction factor
(shallower groundwater increases liquefaction probability).

Table 1: Liquefaction values for different liquefaction susceptibility
categories (LSC). *PGA min* is the minimum ground acceleration required to
initiate liquefaction. *PGA slope* is the slope of the liquefaction probability
curve as a function of PGA, and *PGA int* is the *y*-intercept of that curve.
:math:`P_{ml}` is the Map Area Proportion, which gives the area of liquefaction
within each map unit conditional on liquefaction occurring in the map unit.

Zhu et al (2015)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The model by Zhu et al. (2015) is a logistic regression model requiring
specification of the Vs30, the Compound Topographic Index (CTI), a proxy
for soil wetness or groundwater depth, the PGA experienced at a site,
and the magnitude of the causative earthquake.

The model is quite simple. An explanatory variable :math:`X` is
calculated as:

.. math:: X = 24.1 + \ln PGA_{M,SM} + 0.355\,CTI − 4.784\, ln\, Vs30

and the final probability is the logistic function

.. math:: P(L) = \frac{1}{1+e^X} \; .

The term :math:`PGA_{M,SM}` is the PGA times a nonlinear scaling factor
for the magnitude.

Both the CTI and the Vs30 may be derived from digital elevation data.
The Vs30 may be estimated from the topographic slope through the
equations of Wald and Allen (2007), which uses a very low resolution DEM
compared to modern offerings. As topographic slope tends to increase
with increased DEM resolution, the estimated Vs30 does too; therefore a
low-resolution DEM (i.e., a 1 km resolution) must be used to calculate
Vs30, rather than the 30 m DEM that is the current standard. This
results in a more accurate Vs30 for a given slope measurement, but it
also means that in an urban setting, sub-km-scale variations in slope
are not accounted for.

The CTI (Moore et al., 1991) is a proxy for soil wetness that relates
the topographic slope of a point to the upstream drainage area of that
point, through the relation

.. math:: CTI = \ln (d_a / \tan \delta)

where :math:`d_a` is the upstream drainage area per unit width through
the flow direction (i.e. relating to the DEM resolution). It was
developed for hillslopes, and is not meaningful in certain very flat
areas such as the valley floors of major low-gradient rivers, where the
upstream drainage areas are very large. Unfortunately, this is exactly
where liquefaction is most expected away from coastal settings.
