SUBduction (sub) module
#######################

The :index:`Subduction` module contains software for the construction of subduction earthquake 
sources for the *oq-engine*. The components of this model can be used either
independently or within a workflow similarly to what is described for example
in TODO. 

Defining the geometry of the top of the slab
********************************************

The modelling of earthquake subduction sources starts with the definition of 
the geometry of the slab.
